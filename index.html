    <h1>Welcome to My Sample Website</h1>
    
    <p>Hi there!</p>

    <p>I’m a master's student in Data Science from the University of San Francisco, expected to graduate by July 1st, 2023, with previous work experience in data science predominantly in natural language processing (NLP) and backend development.</p>

    <p>In my current role as an intern at YLabs, I have built a Question Answering system to improve response wait time from weekly to instant. I’m also involved in developing a dashboard for YLabs using various data sources.</p>

    <p>In my previous role at Infosys, I was involved in developing backend APIs and implementing textual semantic search capabilities for Infosys' text analytics platform.</p>

    <p>In my previous role at KeyPoint Technologies, I was responsible for building a low-latency recommendation system for Instaread, a client of the company. Additionally, I was also responsible for developing social networking features of Instaread. I was a member of KeyPoint’s NLP team and worked on other projects which I’m glad to discuss further in detail.</p>

    <p>While working on community features of Instaread, I developed a great interest in the development of backend systems. I believe I can not just restrict myself to data science but also take on software development tasks across your organization.</p>
