    <p>Hi there!</p>

    <p>I’m a master's student in Data Science from the University of San Francisco, with work experience in data science predominantly in natural language processing (NLP) and backend development. My interests include Applied Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Backend Development.</p>

    <p>In my current role as an intern at <a href = "https://www.ylabsglobal.org/work/all/cyberrwanda">YLabs</a>, I have built a Question Answering system to improve response wait time from weekly to instant. I’m also involved in developing a dashboard for YLabs using various data sources including google analytics backend, mongoDB and external csv sources.</p>

    <p>In my previous role at Infosys, I was involved in developing backend APIs and implementing textual semantic search capabilities for Infosys' text analytics platform <a href="https://www.infosys.com/services/application-modernization/offerings/text-analytics-platform.html">(ITAP)</a></p>

    <p>In my previous role at KeyPoint Technologies, I worked on it's flagship product <a href= "https://www.cerinastudio.com/">cerina studio</a>, which is chatbot as a service. I was responsible for building a low-latency recommendation system for <a href = "https://apps.apple.com/us/app/instaread-learn-something-new/id1046172976">Instaread</a>, a client of the organization. Additionally, I was also responsible for developing social networking features of Instaread. I was a member of KeyPoint’s NLP team and worked on other projects which I’m glad to discuss further in detail.</p>

    <p>While working on community features of Instaread, I developed a great interest in the development of backend systems.</p>
