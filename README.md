### Tejaswi Samrat Dasari

Hi there!

I’m a master's student in Data Science from the University of San Francisco, expected to graduate by July 1st 2023, and with previous work experience in data science predominantly in natural language processing (NLP) and backend development.

In my current role, as an intern at YLabs I have built a Question answering system to improve response wait time from weekly to instant. I’m also involved in developing a dashboard for YLabs from their various data sources.

In my role previously at Infosys, I was involved in developing backend APIs and implemented textual semantic search capabilities for Infosy’s text analytics platform.

In my previous role at KeyPoint Technologies, I was responsible for building a low latency recommendation system for Instaread, a client of the company. Additionally, I was also responsible for developing social networking features of Instaread. I was member of KeyPoint’s NLP team and worked on other projects which I’m glad to discuss further in detail.

While working on community features of Instaread, I developed a great interest in development of backend systems. I believe I can not just restrict myself to data science but also to software development tasks across your organization.
